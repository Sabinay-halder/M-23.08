			<p>Babies this age may sleep for six-hour stretches at night, and settle into more of a set nap schedule now. To get baby on a good sleep routine, make sure to play and expose her to lots of sunlight during the day and avoid over-stimulating her when it's dark out. </p>

			<h4 class="section-head">1-2 Year Sleep Tips :</h4>
			<p>Active toddlers can have trouble relaxing and winding down at night -- causing bedtime battles. Try to keep things as calm as possible in the evenings, sticking to soothing activities like bath and story time.</p>
