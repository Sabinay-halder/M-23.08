			<p>
				If you exercised regularly before getting pregnant and your pregnancy is uncomplicated, you can most likely continue working out as before, with modifications as noted below.   
			</p>
			<h3 class="section-head">1. If you didn't work out much before conceiving,  talk to your healthcare provider.</h3>
			<h4 class="section-head">2. Take in Extra Calories :</h4>
			<p>Exercise burns calories, so make sure to eat well to help nourish and strengthen your body. While you're pregnant, you'll naturally gain weight as your baby grows. The amount you'll need to gain will vary based on your pre-pregnancy weight.</p>
			<h4 class="section-head">3. Steer Clear of Dangerous Sports :</h4>
			<p>Avoid contact sports, horseback riding, downhill skiing, or mountain biking. Regular cycling early in your pregnancy should be okay if you're comfortable on a bike, but it's probably best to stick to stationary or recumbent bikes later in pregnancy .</p>
			<h4 class="section-head">4. Wear the Right Clothes :</h4>
			<p>Wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing. Dress in layers so it's easy to peel off a layer or two after you've warmed up or if you feel too hot. </p>
			<h4 class="section-head">5. Warm Up :</h4>
			<p>Warm-ups prepare your muscles and joints for exercise and build your heart rate up slowly. </p>
			<h4 class="section-head">6. Drink Plenty of Water :</h4>
			<p>1 cup(8 Ounces) before exercise , every 20 min. & after finish your workout.Otherwise, you can become dehydrated, which can cause contractions and raise your body temperature, sometimes to levels that are dangerous for you and your baby.</p>
			<h4 class="section-head">7. Don't Lie Flat on Your Back :</h4>
			<p>Avoid lying flat on your back after the first trimester. This position puts pressure on a major vein., which will reduce blood to your heart and may diminish blood flow to your brain and uterus, making you dizzy, short of breath, or nauseated.</p>
			<h4 class="section-head">8.Keep Moving :</h4>
			<p>Standing in one place for prolonged periods – as when you're lifting weights or doing yoga poses – can  decrease blood flow to the uterus and cause blood to pool in your legs, making you dizzy. Keep moving by switching positions or walking in place.</p>
			<h4 class="section-head">9. Don't Overdo it :</h4>
			<p>Don't exercise until you're exhausted. A good rule of thumb: Slow down if you can't comfortably carry on a conversation. </p>
			<h4 class="section-head">10. Don't Get Overheated  :</h4>
			<p>Avoid letting yourself get too hot, especially during the first trimester when your baby's major organs are developing. Raising your core temperature above 102 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 10 minutes could harm your baby.</p>
			<h4 class="section-head">11. Get Up From the Floor Slowly :</h4>
			<p>As your belly grows, your centre of gravity shifts. That's why it's important to take great care when you change positions. Getting up too quickly can make you dizzy and may cause you to lose your footing and fall.</p>
			<h4 class="section-head">12. Cool Down :</h4>
			<p>At the end of your workout, take five to 10 minutes to walk in place and do some pregnancy-friendly stretching. This will allow your heart rate to get back to normal and help to prevent sore muscles.</p>
